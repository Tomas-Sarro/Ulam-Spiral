Given n amounts of numbers rearranged as the following:

17 &emsp;   16 &emsp;   15 &emsp;   14 &emsp; 13 \
18 &emsp;   5 &emsp; &nbsp;   4 &emsp; &nbsp;   3 &emsp; &nbsp; 12 \
19 &emsp;   6 &emsp; &nbsp;   1 &emsp; &nbsp;   2 &emsp; &nbsp; 11 \
20 &emsp;   7 &emsp; &nbsp;   8 &emsp; &nbsp;   9 &emsp; &nbsp; 10 \
21&emsp;    22 &emsp;   23 &emsp;   24 &emsp; 25

We change each prime value into "x"

x &emsp; &nbsp;   16 &emsp;   15 &emsp;   14 &emsp; x \
18 &emsp;   x &emsp; &nbsp;   4 &emsp; &nbsp;   x &emsp; &nbsp; 12 \
x &emsp; &nbsp;  6 &emsp; &nbsp;   1 &emsp; &nbsp;    x &emsp; &nbsp; x \
20 &emsp;   x &emsp; &nbsp;   8 &emsp; &nbsp;   9 &emsp; &nbsp; 10 \
21&emsp;    22 &emsp; &nbsp;  x &emsp; &nbsp; 24 &emsp; 25
